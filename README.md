# Make Like A Tree and Leaf

I got this idea looking out the window. 🌳 🤔 💭

## Concept

- You're growing a tree, starting with soil (seed is implied / buried).
- Tree components to be incorporated into the growing tree.
  - Soil
  - Trunk / Branches
  - Leaves (budding, grown, dying, dead)
- Building up the tree meant to be relatively fun / simple, but maintaining the tree meant to be frantic / challenging.
  - Looking into gameplay loop ideas for this stage
- Grow the trunk, branches, and add leaves as indicated.
- Dead leaves need to be pruned, or the tree will become sick.
- Round is won when the tree is fully grown and maintained for a certain period of time.

## Gameplay

The game is meant for users of a larger amount of Blinks - that number is 18 right now.

### Setup & Tree Phase

The game starts with growing the tree. I'm still working on ideas to gamify this stage. I also might just leave it as is as a fun setup for the gameplay loop.

1. Start by connecting all 18 Blinks.
2. Double-click one to put them into setup mode.
3. Once they're all green, detach them so they are all alone.
4. Take any blink and double click it. This is now your soil.
5. In five seconds your soil will sprout.
6. Add a Blink. This becomes the trunk. Continue to build.
7. When the tree trunk gets to a certain height, it will branch into two paths.
8. Add more Blinks as indicated by the growth path.

### Leaf Phase

Once the tree is grown, the gameplay loop begins. I'm still thinking about how this will work and will need to play test. My initial thought is that there are two teams. One team responsible for maintaining the left side of the tree and one responsible for maintaining the right side of the tree.

It has also been suggested (by a member of the Blinks dev forum) that co-op play is possible with the players trying to keep the tree alive as long as possible.

1. Branch indicates a bud position.
2. Player attaches ununsed Blink to grow a leaf.
3. Leaf grows and random rates.
4. Player must remove dead leaves for fear of harming the tree.

I'm still thinking about the rest. I might want to incorporate more clicking at this point rather than just simply adding and removing leaves for an amount of time.

### Game Timer Idea

Once the branches have finished growing, they send a signal down the trunk to the soil to begin gameplay timer. One idea I had, is that as the timer works its way up the tree, the leaf play becomes more and more frantic.

## About Me

Hello! I'm a professional software engineer and an amateur game designer. What could go wrong? 😂 I live in Northern NJ with my wife and two children. I have _Freddicus Game Studios, LLC_ registered in NJ, and I would consider releasing the game under that LLC if given the opportunity.
