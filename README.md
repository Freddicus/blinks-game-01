# Make Like A Tree and Leaf

I got this idea looking out the window. ðŸŒ³ ðŸ¤” ðŸ’­ Blinks as a tree? I could do that! Also, I like puns. The rest is history...

## Gameplay

The game is meant for users of a larger amount of Blinks. The more Blinks, the larger your tree!

### Setup & Tree Phase

The game starts with growing the tree. You can branch any time during the tree setup by double-clicking a Blink.

1. Take any blink and long press it. This is now your soil. You can undo this action by double-clicking.
2. In a couple of seconds your soil will sprout.
3. Add a Blink. This becomes the trunk. Continue to build in a straight line.
4. When the tree trunk grows to a decent height (four or five Blinks), double-click the last tile you added. It will branch into two paths.
5. Add more Blinks to serve as branches as indicated by the growth path.
6. Double-click a branch at any time to split again.
7. When you're ready to play, long press the sprout and the timer will begin!

An example setup is three to five vertical Blinks (one soil and two to four trunk) and eight branch Blinks (four on each side). If you have a large collection of blinks, your can branch your branches and make the tree as large as you'd like. Make sure you have at least two collector Blinks per player.

### Collection Phase

Once you finish constructing your tree, long press the sprout to start the next phase of the game. 

1. Random branches will indicate a leaf position.
2. Player attaches their collector Blink to a matching color leaf and presses their button to collect a matching color leaf from the tree.
3. The player who fills all of their collectors first wins.
4. If the timer runs out everybody loses.

### Timer

Once you start the game, a timer starts. The more trunk you have, the longer the timer. The timer works its way up the tree.

### Reseting the Game

Connect all of the blinks together and triple click one of them. Then separate all of them until the green pulsing stops.

## About Me

Hello! I'm a professional software engineer and an amateur game designer. I don't have a Blinks dev kit, yet, but I'm charging forward anyway. ðŸ˜…

A few years ago, I registered _Freddicus Game Studios, LLC_ in my state with lofty hopes and a beginner's knowlegde of Unity under my belt. After many stalled prototypes, my game aspirations faultered...until now. ðŸ˜Š I live in Northern NJ with my wife and two children. I would love to be considered by Move38 for an official release.
