# Make Like A Tree and Leaf

I got this idea looking out the window. ðŸŒ³ ðŸ¤” ðŸ’­ Blinks as a tree? I could do that! Also, I like puns. The rest is history...

## Gameplay

The game is meant for users of a larger amount of Blinks. The more Blinks, the larger your tree!

### Setup & Tree Phase

The game starts with growing the tree. You can branch any time during the tree setup by double-clicking a Blink.

1. Take any blink and double click it. This is now your soil. You can undo this action by double-clicking a second time.
2. In five seconds your soil will sprout.
3. Add a Blink. This becomes the trunk. Continue to build in a straight line.
4. When the tree trunk grows to a decent height (four or five Blinks), double-click the last tile you added. It will branch into two paths.
5. Add more Blinks to serve as branches as indicated by the growth path.
6. Double-click a branch at any time to split again.
7. When you're ready to play, long press the sprout and the timer will begin!

An example setup (before play-testing ðŸ™ƒ) is five vertical Blinks (one soil and four trunk) and eight branch Blinks (four on each side). That will give you four leaves to play with.

### Leaf Phase

Once you finish constructing your tree, long press the sprout to start the next phase of the game. You can play cooporatively to keep the tree alive, or players/teams can work to keep their own branch alive.

1. Press the sprout to send a growth signal.
2. Random branches will indicate a bud position.
3. Player attaches ununsed Blink to a bud to grow a leaf.
4. The leaves mature and eventually brown.
5. Player must remove dead leaves for fear of harming the tree.
6. If all the branch segments die, then the player loses.

More gameplay is still TBD with play testing. I might want to incorporate more clicking at this point rather than just simply adding and removing leaves for an amount of time.

### Timer

Once you start the game, a timer starts. The more trunk you have, the longer the timer. The timer works its way up the tree. To be implemented - make the leaf play becomes more and more frantic as the timer fills up.

### Branch Bud Affinity Idea

Players will repeatedly click Blinks on their half of the branch to gain budding affinity. This could serve to distract the player from pruning and introduce a kind of tug-of-war.

### Alternative Win-State Idea

Instead of having branch-segments die, I'm thinking that maybe successful leaves reduce the timer and unpruned leaves increase the timer? Could be fun. Will need to branch the code and test this.

## About Me

Hello! I'm a professional software engineer and an amateur game designer. I don't have a Blinks dev kit, yet, but I'm charging forward anyway. ðŸ˜…

A few years ago, I registered _Freddicus Game Studios, LLC_ in my state with lofty hopes and a beginner's knowlegde of Unity under my belt. After many stalled prototypes, my game aspirations faultered...until now. ðŸ˜Š I live in Northern NJ with my wife and two children. I would love to be considered by Move38 for an official release.
